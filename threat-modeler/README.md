# Threat-Modeler — Example Reports

Sample outputs from the **threat-modeler** plugin, run against public test
applications. Use them to see the report structure, depth levels and artifact
formats before running a scan of your own.

## What's here

Each run produces a set of files that share a common slug
`threat-model-<target>-<depth>-v<version>`:

| Report formats | Data and integration formats |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| `.md` — human-readable report | `.yaml` — structured model |
| `.html` — browser-readable report | `.sarif.json` — SARIF v2.1 code-scanning results |
| `.pdf` — printable report with cover and TOC | `.threatdragon.json` — Threat Dragon and ThreatAtlas export |
| | `pentest-tasks-*.yaml` — endpoint catalog and pentest plan |

Optional outputs are linked for each run below when they were generated.

The `-vX.Y` suffix is the plugin version that produced the run, so outputs from
different releases stay side by side and comparable.

## Assessment depths

For component coverage criteria, cost, and runtime guidance, see [Assessment depth and cost control](https://github.com/appsec-foundry/appsec-advisor/blob/main/docs/threat-modeler.md#assessment-depth--cost-control).

- **quick** — early feedback and low-risk changes; reduced analysis that skips
  abuse-case validation and final model-based QA.
- **standard** *(default)* — normal threat models and security reviews; full
  analysis, abuse-case validation, and QA.
- **thorough** — high-risk services and major releases; deeper component
  analysis and architecture review.

## Large-component-count test fixture

Files matching `threat-model-insecure-large-spring-app-v0.5.2*` were generated
from the custom-built
[Insecure Large Spring App](https://github.com/matthiasrohr/insecure-large-spring-app)
repository. The fixture was built to test how the threat-modeling process handles
applications with a large number of components.

The repository defines 42 Docker Compose services across 7 network zones. The
standard run represents the system as 11 logical components, identifies 122
entry points and performs full STRIDE analysis on 8 components. The other 3
remain in the inventory but are not analyzed individually at standard depth.
